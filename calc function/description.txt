How to use the CSS calc() function.

[Description]

CSS calc() is a function used for simple calculations to determine CSS property values right in CSS.
The calc() function allows mathematical expressions with addition (+), subtraction (-), 
multiplication (*), and division (/) to be used as component values.

[Advantages]

The most useful feature of this function is the ability to mix units. 
For example, you can multiply pixels with percentage.
What if I’m already using math functions with a preprocessor? 
If you’re using preprocessor math functions then it’s time to switch to native CSS math 
because it’s more powerful and you can simply do more things with it.

[Syntax and a few things to note]

.item{
  width: calc(100% - 60px);
}
